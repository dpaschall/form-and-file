# form-and-file
The Form and File Project - Let Machines do the sorting for you!

Current state of affairs:

imported the tutorials from tensorflow.org
https://github.com/tensorflow/models
  Projects/tensortutorials/models/tutorials/

Want to test out this new model for image recognition!
Described here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition



TASK LIST:
DONE: Confirm the Cifar10 Model worked
Go about modifying a model (not yet chosen) for the form and file sorter
  Projects/form-and-file/
  
  
  Final Objective
From Picture(pixel-size-constant) to sorted, searchable pdf(or word) file names and tags. Machine learned algorithm that takes    (distorted or human written) forms it knows and automatically categorizes them using CNN (no not the news channel, a convolutional neural network).
